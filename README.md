# Exam_decode
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people; to see if they could become something more.


Details of each section - 

ðŸ‘‰ Home -> It is the website's landing page, where people can access our portfolio pages. There is a group photo, the group name, and a short description in the background. Below it, the portfolio pages section is located. At the bottom, the footer section is located. 

[NOTE: 1. Not all the portfolio pages have been made yet, so they will not be redirected to our portfolio pages. But if we get time, we will make it and attach it here.
2. In the footer section, social media icons suggest that it will redirect to our group pages on specific platforms, but without YouTube, we didn't have any pages on these platforms.] 

ðŸ‘‰ Contact Us -> It is a personalized connection page where people can connect with us individually through various social media platforms. 

[NOTE: Pop-ups will appear for cases where the person has no account on that platform.] 

ðŸ‘‰ Our Goals -> The design is enough to say it is basically the group projects that will be presented here, not the individual ones. The project photo will be there with a short description, and to see the complete project, we need to click the "Click Here" option, and it will be directed to a new page. 

[NOTE: As of now, we don't have any group projects, we have some individual projects, but that should not appear here. So these sections are also not available.] 

ðŸ‘‰ About Us -> This page tells us our story and what we have done and want to do. There is a video (I'm not good at video editing ðŸ˜…, a beautiful vlog will be coming and replacing this video, but as of now, it will be there) and some cards from here so people can access our CV.

[NOTE: Pop-ups will appear for cases where the person doesn't have their CV.] 

It was enjoyable to learn and work on my own designed website; thank you all for supporting me.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š It is my first attempt, so please don't overlook the flaws and give me feedback.
